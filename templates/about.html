						Hi, I'm Jack Fordyce.	I grew up in rural Iowa, in a town of ten thousand-ish people. Big things were happening all around me. There was always that sense of "I need to get out" common amongst high school age students living in the rural Midwest I think. So, I promptly decided to attend college at Buena Vista University, in a town even smaller than the one I grew up in, in the same state. My plan didn't stick. Regardless, I spent four years focused on learning as much as I could (there wasn't a ton to do in my college town) and graduated with a degree in Computer Science.

						<h3>What I do</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="aboutme-desc container-fluid">
						I began working for Principal Financial Group in the summer of 2019 as a software engineer intern. I continued that internship throughout my senior year of college, working remotely from my school's campus. I am now a full time software engineer at Principal and work in a small team of engineers focused on application hosting and API gateways. We manage application runtimes and API gateways through configuration as code with tools such as Ansible. I have a drive to make things work, over and over again. There is no better sight than a machine running at full efficiency, regardless of what that machine may be. I am never more satisfied than after watching a complex problem organize itself under the pressure of good engineering.
